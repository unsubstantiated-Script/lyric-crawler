# Tapping into a Lyrics API -- Lyric Crawler

**Version 1.0.0**

Code for a small Traversy Project

Challenges faced:

- Tweaking the design to fit a different look
- Working with a CSS :after pseudo-class
- Finding, editing, and implementing a photo that wasn't in the curriculum to suit my stylistic choices
