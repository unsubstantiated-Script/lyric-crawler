# Tapping into a Lyrics API -- Lyric Crawler

**Version 1.0.0**

Code for a small Traversy Project

Challenges faced:

- Tweaking the design to fit a different look
- Working with a CSS :after pseudo-class
- Finding, editing, and implementing a photo that wasn't in the curriculum to suit my stylistic choice

ToDos:

- Find and pull docs from a chordsheet API if one exists. If not? Make one? (beware the copyright daemons!)
- Find a way to integrate a set list generator to make this into a band prep app
